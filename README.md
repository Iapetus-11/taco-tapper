# [ðŸŒ® Taco Tapper](tacos.iapetus11.me/)

_A cookie clicker clone with tacos instead, because they're tastier_

I built this with my girlfriend [@devilsquares](https://github.com/devilsquares/) as a fun little project. I wrote the TypeScript + Vue and she drew the nice art. While it is playable, it is currently unfinished.
